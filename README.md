# ♻️ Waste Classification System (ML)

### ℹ️ Project Overview
This machine learning system classifies waste into categories (like paper, plastic, or metal) to automate recycling processes. I built this using Python and Scikit-learn to demonstrate high-accuracy data cleaning and model training.

### 🚀 Key Features
- Automated Data Cleaning: I formatted raw inputs and removed corrupt entries to optimize system accuracy.
- High-Speed Data Handling: Proved ability to manage complex digital records with meticulous attention to detail.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

### 📂 Dataset
This model was trained using the TrashNet dataset. Due to GitHub's file size limits, the raw images are not included here.
